- Language - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- Auth - [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
- Database - [Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres)

This template uses the new Next.js App Router. This includes support for enhanced layouts, colocation of components, tests, and styles, component-level data fetching, and more.

## Getting Started

During the deployment, Vercel will prompt you to create a new Postgres database. This will add the necessary environment variables to your project.

Inside the Vercel Postgres dashboard, create a table based on the schema defined in this repository.

```
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  due_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  last_modify_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```
Next, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values. Follow the instructions in the `.env.example` file to set up your GitHub OAuth application.

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

Finally, run the following commands to start the development server:

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.
